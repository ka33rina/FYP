    "text": "In urban development, there is a significant challenge of conceptual designs being laid out by architects and urban planners that do not always align with the practical needs and preferences of people who use these spaces. After the implementation of these designs, it often becomes evident that there is a gap between the envisioned plans and the community’s practical needs, which should truly align with their desires for accessibility. This gap then results in “desired lines” which are natural walkways or routes that people prefer to take when moving between locations. These pathways are not originally implemented but emerge organically based on their needs and preferences.\nWith limited land and space to work with in Singapore, the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Singapore (URA) aims to bridge this gap by developing a framework that they can use to prevent the need for retrofitting. Additionally, with future estates in consideration, URA aims to effectively build an estate with more direct and accessible paths from HDB estates to key amenities.\n\n\n\nOur project aims to bridge this gap by reevaluating an existing estate with these desired lines and developing a comprehensive framework that eliminates the need for such pathways. The framework will be one that URA will ultimately leverage and follow to plan for future estates that contain more direct paths to key amenities. Through this project, we are committed to rearranging the urban environment through a user-centric perspective that optimally accommodates the community’s movements, thus eliminating the disconnect between conceptual designs and practical needs.\nAdditionally, we recognise that retrofitting is difficult. Therefore, our focus is on preemptively eliminating the need for retrofitting by ensuring that the initial designs of walkways are in harmony with the community’s needs. This proactive strategy not only saves resources but also creates convenience for residents to travel to and from key amenities.\n\n\n\nThe project aligns with the goal of creating an inclusive and accessible urban environment within the Smart City Framework. Our project aims to enhance accessibility for everyone within the city by ensuring that urban spaces are designed to truly accommodate the needs of pedestrians. By studying how people navigate their surroundings, we gain valuable insights into their practical needs and desired walkways. This in-depth analysis allows us to design urban spaces that organically align with the way residents move, eliminating the disconnect between conceptual designs and real-life requirements.

    "text": "Purpose of Dashboard\nThis dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview by looking at factors such as age groups, gender, years etc for each area respectively.\n\nAng Mo Kio Dashboard\nOverall, the trends suggest a shift in the demographic composition across age groups of child, middle aged and young adults in Ang Mo Kio. With a decrease in children and young adults, a steady increase in the elderly population, and a decline in the middle-aged population over the past decade. In terms of age group distribution in AMK, the highest population is in the age group 55-59, while the lowest is in the age group 85 and over. \nIn the age group trend of the nested group, the graph suggests a decreasing trend in the combined population of children and young adults, while the combined population of middle-aged and elderly individuals shows a slight increase with some fluctuations over the years. Generally, the male and female populations tend to be comparable, but there are a few age groups where one gender may slightly outnumber the other. The gender distribution appears relatively balanced in the younger age groups. As individuals age, the gender ratio may exhibit some variations, but in general, there is no significant skew toward one gender. In the older age groups, there is a trend of more females than males, especially in the 85 and over category.\n\n\nPunggol Dashboard\nBased on the Age Group Trend chart in Punggol, there has been a notable change in the demographic composition across age groups in Punggol over the past decade with significant increases across all age groups over the past decade, suggesting a transformation in the demographic composition of the area. The highest population is in the age group 30-34, with a total of 182,410 individuals, followed by the age group 35-39 with 199,160 individuals. These age groups represent the peak working-age population. Overall, the chart indicates a substantial working-age population and a decreasing trend in older age groups. \nIn the nested chart, both groups, “Child + Young Adults” and “Middle Aged + Elderly,” experience significant population growth over the years, indicating demographic changes in these age categories. The overall trend indicates an increasing population in Punggol, with both younger and older age groups contributing to this growth. Lastly, the data suggests a generally balanced gender distribution across age groups, with some variations in specific age brackets. In the working-age groups, there are variations, with some age groups having more females (25-34), and others having more males (40-49)."
