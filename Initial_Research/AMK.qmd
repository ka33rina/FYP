### Key Amenities 

-   Mayflower MRT Station 

-   Mayflower Market & Food Centre 

-   Kebun Baru Community Club

### Desired Lines:

showing map layer/ distribution of desired lines

### Observations: 

#### In terms of walkability: 

-   Desired paths are commonly found nearby existing traffic light crossroad

    Assumption: Long waiting time for traffic lights reduce the patience of residents to cross safely

-   Jaywalking are common within the neighborhood

    Assumption: the current designed paths are not the most direct path → residents tend to find a shortcut by themselves
